		<img src ="camiguin.png" width="650" height="660" alt= ""/>
	<p><br>Camiguin is a small and peaceful island province in the Philippines located in the Bohol Sea off the northern coast of Mindanao. It may be the smallest island in Mindanao and the second smallest province in the Philippines, but it has surprisingly a lot of tourist spots to offer. Dubbed the “Island Born of Fire,” Camiguin is home to seven volcanoes that continue to shape and reshape its unique landscape.The interior forest reserves known as Mount Hibok-Hibok Protected Landscape have been declared an ASEAN Heritage Park. But for beach lovers, it’s the water-based attractions that make Camiguin special.This compact island also hides numerous waterfalls, natural springs, unspoiled beaches and diving spots that will please adventurous travelers. Camiguin is home to a mysterious Sunken Cemetery which continues to fascinate travelers from all over the world.Camiguin is also famous for its sweet lanzones fruits for which an annual festival is dedicated. Geographically part of Region 10 or Northern Mindanao, Camiguin was formerly a part of the Misamis Oriental. This province is tiny compared to neighboring provinces in the mainland region and it maintains the same laidback beach vibe similar to top island-hopping destinations in the Philippines such as Bohol and Siquijor.

<center><h1><b>HISTORY</h1>
	<img src ="HISTORY.png" width="650" height="660" alt= ""/>
	<p><br><center>The name Camiguin is derived from the native word “Kamagong”, a species of the ebony tree. Explorers Ferdinand Magellan and Miguel Lopez de Legaspi landed in Camiguin in 1521 and 1565, respectively. The first Spanish settlement was established in 1598 in what is now Guinsiliban. Guinsiliban which comes from the old Kinamiguin word “Ginsil-ipan” which means “to look out for pirates from a watchtower” has an old Spanish watchtower where the Camiguinons kept watch for Moro pirates. The first major Spanish settlement established in 1679 was called Katagman or Katadman (known as Catarman). The settlement grew and prospered but was destroyed by the eruption of Mt. Vulcan in 1871. The former location is what is now Barangay Bonbon of Catarman. On July 4, 1946, the Philippines gained independence from the US. Camiguin was then part of Misamis Oriental. In 1958, it became a sub-province and was made into a separate province on June 18, 1966, and formally inaugurated in 1968.

	<p><br><center>White Island is one of the famous tourist spots in Camiguin which is about 1.4 kilometers off the northeastern coasts of the mainland. It is actually a spectacular sandbar devoid of any vegetation and just pure and soft white sand. This lovely sandbar is even made into a picture-perfect destination surrounded by turquoise waters with a great view of Mount Hibok-Hibok and Mount Vulcan of the mainland. The best time to visit on the island is on the early morning or late afternoon to avoid the scorching sun.
